# Introduction to Random Forests

## 1) Introduction

- introduction of machine learning

Simple definition:
Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Samuel, 1959)

More engineering-oriented definition: 
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. (Mitchell, 1997)

Supervised, unsupervised

- what are the differences?

Supervised learning is classification where the goal is to find a relationship in the data.

Unsupervised learning is clustering where the structure of the data is unknown and this type of algorithm can solve.

- examples of machine learning 

Some examples include image recognition, speech recognition, medical diagnosis, and spam classification. (sort these into supervised and unsupervised, have examples for both)

All of these type of problems is handled by inputting data known as the training set which the system uses to learn.

- what is random forest

supervised learning -> classification

Random forest is an ensemble Machine Learning Technique. (Abhilasha, 2017)

Random forest uses decision trees as base classifier. Used for classification and regression of data. 

Random forest is a classifier consisting of collection of tree-structured classifiers where independent random vectors are distributed identically and each tree cast a unit vote for the most popular class at input x.

- what is ensemble

Data mining technique composed of number of individual classifiers to classify the data to generate new instances of data. (rewrite)

- what is model used for?
- what is needed?



## 2) Preliminaries

- diagram of model
- how it comes together

- what are the requirements to run it?

## 3) Development

- what values does it take in and outputs? (x and y)
- how is it trained?



## 4) Testing

- overfitting/underfitting, how to check

- outputs
- what does the model answer? 


## 5) Discussion

what are advantages/disadvantage using this versus another machine learning algorithm?

- tie in introduction and conclude
